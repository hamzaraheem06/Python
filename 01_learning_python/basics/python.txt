Python is a cool language.

Internal working of Python:
In other fundamental programming languages like C/C++, Java, etc., the source code is converted to machine code, machine code gives direct instructions to the computer hardware. However, Python code is firstly compiled to something called as Byte Code (.pyc). 

Byte Code is not a machine code. It cannot give direct instructions to CPU. This is done for the sake of optimization when we import multiple modules in a file. It doesn't happen when we work on a single or a top level file because there is no need of further optimization as there is one long single code that can be interpreted directly.

To execute/interprete this Byte Code, Python has a Python Virtual Machine (PVM) which interpretes this code and we get the output.

A simple flow chart of this would be:

Python Code (.py) ---(compiling)---> Byte Code (.pyc) ---(PVM)---> Output
